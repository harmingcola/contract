Contract
========

A jvm contract based testing tool for http clients and servers.

The aim of this library is to simplify the testing and development of any service that either produces or consumes
something produced via http.

Our approach favors neither side of the client server relationship, removing the *consumer driven* from *consumer
driven contracts* and you're left with just contracts. By favouring neither side, we're focusing on the interaction.
