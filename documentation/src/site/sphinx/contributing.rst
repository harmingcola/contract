============

Documentation

Feel free to send a pull request with any fixes / updates / improvement to our docs that you think might help.

Feature Requests
----------------
Create a post in the `google group <https://groups.google.com/d/forum/seekay-contracts>`_ with as much detail as you can give, sample contracts would be awesome too.

Bugs
----
Create an issue on the project `github <https://github.com/harmingcola/contract/issues>`_ with as much detail as possible, contracts / test cases that recreate the bug would be awesome. Even better, a pull request that fixes the bug.

Merge Requests
--------------
1. Fork & clone the project
2. Implement whatever it is that you'd like
3. Push to a branch in your forked repo with a name that roughly explains what you're implementing
4. Update docs where necessary.
5. Create a pull request into the master branch on our repo
6. If it looks good we'll accept.


Our Design Considerations / Conventions / Quirks
------------------------------------------------
1. The main project and two testing projects are written in Java
2. Unit tests are written in `Spock <http://spockframework.github.io/spock/docs/1.0/index.html>`_
