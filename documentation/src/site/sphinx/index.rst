Contract
========

A jvm contract based testing tool for HTTP clients and servers.

The aim of this library is to simplify the development and testing of any service that produces via HTTP or a client
that consumes via HTTP.

Our approach favors neither side of the client server relationship, removing the *consumer driven* from *consumer
driven contracts* and you're left with just contracts. By favouring neither side, we're focusing on the interaction.
